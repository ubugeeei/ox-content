# @ox-content/vite-plugin-solid

Solid integration for Ox Content - embed Solid components in Markdown.

## Installation

```bash
vp install @ox-content/vite-plugin-solid solid-js@next @solidjs/web@next @solidjs/vite-plugin
```

This 3.x beta adapter targets Solid 2 and `@solidjs/vite-plugin`. It does not
preserve the Solid 1 + `vite-plugin-solid` peer dependency path; keep the older
adapter release if your app has to stay on Solid 1.

## Usage

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import solid from "@solidjs/vite-plugin";
import { oxContentSolid } from "@ox-content/vite-plugin-solid";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    oxContentSolid({
      srcDir: "docs",
      // Auto-discover components with glob pattern
      components: "./src/components/*.tsx",
    }),
    solid({ extensions: [".md", ".markdown", ".mdx"], compiler: "native" }),
  ],
});
```

## Plugin Order and `extensions`

Unlike the Vue, React, and Svelte integrations, this plugin has two setup rules
that are not optional. Both follow from the same fact: **Solid's JSX is
compile-time only.** There is no runtime element factory like React's
`createElement` or Vue's `h` to fall back on, so Markdown is emitted as Solid
JSX and `@solidjs/vite-plugin` is what turns it into DOM or SSR instructions.

1. `oxContentSolid()` must come **before** `solid()` in the `plugins` array.
   Both plugins are `enforce: "pre"`, so array order decides which one sees the
   Markdown file first. If `solid()` runs first, the Solid compiler sees raw
   Markdown instead of the generated JSX.
2. `solid()` must be given the Markdown extensions. Use
   `compiler: "native"` for the Solid 2 native OXC compiler path. Without the
   extensions, generated Markdown modules would be handed to the browser as
   uncompiled JSX.

Both mistakes are checked for you and reported with the fix — see
[`verifySolidPlugin`](#verifysolidplugin).

## Options

### components

- Type: `string | string[] | Record<string, string>`

Components to register for use in Markdown. Supports:

#### Glob Pattern (Recommended)

```ts
// Single pattern
components: "./src/components/*.tsx";

// Multiple patterns
components: ["./src/components/*.tsx", "./src/ui/*.tsx"];
```

Component names are derived from file names in PascalCase:

- `counter.tsx` → `Counter`
- `my-button.tsx` → `MyButton`

#### Explicit Map

```ts
components: {
  Counter: './src/components/Counter.tsx',
  Alert: './src/components/Alert.tsx',
}
```

### verifySolidPlugin

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`

Fail fast on the two setup mistakes described above instead of letting them
surface as an unrelated syntax error.

The plugin check runs when the config resolves; the `extensions` check runs the
first time a Markdown module comes out of the pipeline still uncompiled. Both
throw a message naming the fix.

Turn it off when Solid's JSX is compiled by something other than
`@solidjs/vite-plugin`.

## Using Components in Markdown

Register shared components in the global `components` map, or import a
component from the document that uses it.

```markdown
# My Page

Here's an interactive counter:

<Counter start={5} />

And an alert:

<Alert type="warning">
  This is a warning message!
</Alert>
```

On `.mdx`, a relative import is local to that file and overrides the global
map when the names match:

```md
import GtvChart from './gtv-chart/GtvChart.tsx'

<GtvChart title="ok" />
```

Optional `renderIsland(name, props, filePath)` can replace island inner HTML
at transform time. The hook belongs on the Solid adapter; `@ox-content/vite-plugin`
does not import `@solidjs/web` for SSR.

## Example Component

```tsx
// src/components/Counter.tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

export default function Counter(props: { start?: number }) {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(props.start ?? 0);

  return (
    <div class="counter">
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count() - 1)}>-</button>
      <span>{count()}</span>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that `props` is not destructured. Solid props are a reactive proxy, and
destructuring them reads every value once at setup time, which is what breaks
reactivity in components ported from React.

## Virtual Modules

- `virtual:ox-content-solid/components` - Registered components

```ts
import components from "virtual:ox-content-solid/components";
```

There is no `virtual:ox-content-solid/runtime` counterpart to the Svelte
integration's: Solid mounts through `render` from `@solidjs/web`, which the
generated modules import directly.

## Islands

Markdown that uses a registered or document-imported component is emitted with
island markers and hydrated through `@ox-content/islands`, the same runtime the
other framework integrations use. Each island is mounted with `render` from
`@solidjs/web` and disposed when the Markdown component unmounts.

Markdown without any registered or document-imported component skips the island
runtime entirely and compiles to a single `innerHTML` binding.

## HTML-string custom hosts

Hosts that call `renderMarkdown()` and then place the returned HTML inside their
own Solid page shell can use the Solid adapter without importing each Markdown
document as a Vite module. `createSolidHtmlHostRenderer()` prepares the common
document-local MDX import resolution, server module loading, diagnostics policy,
and client module id mapping for that host.

```ts
import { createSolidHtmlHostRenderer, type MdxImport } from "@ox-content/vite-plugin-solid";

const imports: MdxImport[] = [
  { source: "./Chart.tsx", specifiers: [{ imported: "default", local: "Chart", kind: "default" }] },
];
const renderIslands = createSolidHtmlHostRenderer({
  root: "/repo",
  srcDir: "docs",
  loadModule: (moduleId) => viteDevServer.ssrLoadModule(moduleId),
});

const rendered = await renderIslands(markdown.html, {
  documentPath: "/repo/docs/report.mdx",
  imports,
  components: { Badge: "./src/components/Badge.tsx" },
});
```

The factory keeps the module cache scoped to one render call, so development
edits should trigger a fresh call after the host invalidates its page state. By
default it maps server module ids through `toSolidHtmlHostClientModuleId()` and
throws `SolidHtmlHostRenderError` when diagnostics are produced. Use
`diagnostics: "collect"` to return diagnostics without throwing, or pass
`resolveClientModule()` / `renderComponent()` when a host needs custom browser
ids or SSR rendering.

The resolved client identity is written to each island as `data-ox-module`,
along with `data-ox-export`. Use the same keys in the browser loader map so two
documents can reuse a local component name without downstream HTML replacement.
For unusual integrations, call the lower-level `renderSolidHtmlHost()` directly.

Diagnostics report missing components, module load failures, missing exports,
SSR errors, and unsupported document-local import forms with document/component
context. The supported document-local forms are the same ones the Markdown-module
adapter understands: default imports and named imports with local bindings.

The browser client lives on a separate subpath so custom hosts can bundle it
without importing Vite, Node helpers, or native optional dependencies:
`@ox-content/vite-plugin-solid/html-host/client`. It is a fresh-mount bridge,
not Solid hydration. It reads the existing Ox Content island payload and authored
slot HTML, clears the target, and lets the caller mount with `@solidjs/web`.
When SSR produced HTML for a self-closing island, that rendered output is not
passed back as children.

For production custom hosts, generate the module map from the same
site-selected document set instead of a broad source-directory glob. Keep the
publication rule in your site code and share that selected list with both the
custom host routes and the registry plugin.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import solid from "@solidjs/vite-plugin";
import { oxContentCustomHost } from "@ox-content/vite-plugin";
import { createSolidHtmlHostIslandRegistry } from "@ox-content/vite-plugin-solid";
import { selectedDocuments } from "./src/site-content";

const solidIslands = createSolidHtmlHostIslandRegistry({
  documents: async () =>
    (await selectedDocuments()).map((document) => ({
      documentPath: document.file,
      source: document.source,
    })),
});

export default defineConfig({
  appType: "custom",
  plugins: [
    solidIslands.plugin,
    oxContentCustomHost({ host: "./src/site-host.ts" }),
    solid({ compiler: "native" }),
  ],
});
```

```ts
// src/site-host.ts
import { renderMarkdown, type MdxImport } from "@ox-content/vite-plugin";
import { createSolidHtmlHostRenderer } from "@ox-content/vite-plugin-solid";
import { selectedDocuments } from "./site-content";

export default {
  async routes() {
    return (await selectedDocuments()).map((document) => ({
      path: document.url,
      inputPath: document.file,
      source: document.source,
      async render(ctx) {
        const markdown = await renderMarkdown(document.source, document.file, {
          srcDir: "content",
        });
        const renderIslands = createSolidHtmlHostRenderer({
          root: ctx.root,
          srcDir: "content",
          loadModule: ctx.loadModule,
        });
        const rendered = await renderIslands(markdown.html, {
          imports: markdown.imports as MdxImport[],
          documentPath: document.file,
        });
        return { html: rendered.html, source: document.source };
      },
    }));
  },
};
```

The browser imports the generated virtual module. Its static dynamic-import
roots are the selected island modules only, so Vite does not create entry chunks
for unpublished documents that were omitted by your site policy. Dependencies
reachable from those selected modules are still bundled normally.

```tsx
import { initIslands } from "@ox-content/islands";
import { render } from "@solidjs/web";
import { initSolidHtmlHost } from "@ox-content/vite-plugin-solid/html-host/client";
import modules from "virtual:ox-content-solid/html-host/modules";

initSolidHtmlHost({
  initIslands,
  modules,
  render({ component: Component, props, element, slotHtml }) {
    const dispose = render(
      () =>
        slotHtml ? (
          <Component {...props}>
            <div innerHTML={slotHtml} />
          </Component>
        ) : (
          <Component {...props} />
        ),
      element,
    );
    return dispose;
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  },
  options: { selector: ".ox-content [data-ox-island]" },
});
```

`initSolidHtmlHost()` calls the `initIslands()` function supplied by the host and
returns its controller. If you already manage the island runtime yourself, use
`createSolidHtmlHostLazyHydrate()` from the same subpath and pass the returned
synchronous hydrate function to `initIslands()`. The adapter keeps pending lazy
imports cancellable: disposal before a module resolves prevents stale mount,
mounted cleanup runs exactly once, and unknown module, loader, runtime, export,
and render failures are reported to `onError`.

## Island stylesheets for custom hosts

Server-rendered islands often need their CSS before the client module mounts.
When you use `oxContentCustomHost()`, prefer the public host assets context so
the host never touches a Vite manifest or development module graph directly.

```ts
const styles = ctx.assets.stylesheets({
  modules: rendered.clientModules.map((module) => module.moduleId),
});

const assets = ctx.assets.document({
  islandStyles: styles.stylesheets,
  clientEntries: ["src/main.ts"],
});

return {
  html: `<!doctype html><html><head>${assets.headHtml}</head><body>${rendered.html}</body></html>`,
  dependencies: styles.dependencies,
};
```

The assets context resolves direct and transitive island CSS before the client
module script, deduplicates through `ctx.assets.document()`, preserves dev CSS
query strings, and returns dependency paths that keep cached custom-host routes
fresh after stylesheet edits. Build mode uses the Vite manifest behind the same
method and returns emitted hashed hrefs for the same module identities. The
lower-level `resolveSolidIslandStylesheets()` helper remains available for
non-custom hosts that intentionally own the manifest or module graph.

## HMR

Components are hot-reloaded when modified. Markdown modules that use a changed
component are invalidated alongside it.

## Rust and N-API Codegen

The Rust renderer can also emit Solid code directly from rendered Markdown HTML,
without the Vite pipeline:

```ts
import { renderFrameworkComponentCode } from "@ox-content/napi";

renderFrameworkComponentCode("<p>Hello</p>", "solid", [], "component");
```

That path targets `solid-js/h`, Solid's hyperscript entry point, because it has
to produce code that runs without the JSX compiler. The Vite plugin emits JSX
instead, which compiles to faster, finer-grained output.
