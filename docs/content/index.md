      - This project is not an official VoidZero product.
      - ubugeeei is building ox-content as an unofficial proposal, hoping it could someday be adopted as vp doc.
      - The current branding and visual references are unofficial fan work and will be revised or taken down if VoidZero or the relevant rights holders ask.

## What Ox Content Is

Ox Content is a Rust-powered document generator and high-performance Markdown processing toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

If you want the shortest explanation, it is best understood as `cargo doc` for JavaScript with a Vite-native workflow.

It also works as a framework-agnostic documentation pipeline with extra batteries included: built-in OG image generation, full-text search, theming hooks, API doc generation, and a reusable content engine.

The site output is zero-JavaScript-first and MPA-oriented by default, so the baseline experience stays fast and simple. When you do need interactivity, Ox Content can hydrate islands and integrate with Vue, Svelte, and React.

Under the hood, Ox Content is not only a docs theme. It also exposes the Markdown parser, renderer, transforms, and plugin system as reusable pieces, so you can use it as a Markdown library outside the default site generator.

## Why It Is Fast

- Implemented in Rust with arena-based allocation and zero-copy parsing where possible
- Designed to reuse ideas and ecosystem conventions that feel natural alongside the VoidZero family
- Optimized for static, cache-friendly multi-page output instead of assuming a heavy client runtime

## Integrations

- [Vue Integration Example](./examples/integ-vue.md) - Embed Vue components in Markdown
- [React Integration Example](./examples/integ-react.md) - Use React islands inside Markdown pages
- [Svelte Integration Example](./examples/integ-svelte.md) - Bring Svelte components into the same pipeline

## Benchmarks

Ox Content is positioned both as a document generator and as a high-performance Markdown toolkit. The numbers below focus on the Markdown engine side.

Latest local benchmark sweep on 2026-04-24 with Node `v24.15.0` on Apple M5 Pro. The tables below show median results from 7 local runs of the benchmark harness for the large 48.7 KB case.

### Parse Only (48.7 KB)

| Library            | ops/sec | avg time |  throughput |
| ------------------ | ------: | -------: | ----------: |
| `@ox-content/napi` |    2607 |  0.38 ms | 124.04 MB/s |
| `md4x (napi)`      |     856 |  1.17 ms |  40.74 MB/s |
| `md4w (md4c)`      |     782 |  1.28 ms |  37.22 MB/s |
| `markdown-it`      |     629 |  1.59 ms |  29.96 MB/s |
| `marked`           |     336 |  2.97 ms |  16.00 MB/s |
| `remark`           |      28 | 35.61 ms |   1.34 MB/s |

### Parse + Render (48.7 KB)

| Library             | ops/sec | avg time |  throughput |
| ------------------- | ------: | -------: | ----------: |
| `@ox-content/napi`  |    3143 |  0.32 ms | 149.58 MB/s |
| `Bun.markdown.html` |    2879 |  0.35 ms | 137.01 MB/s |
| `md4x (napi)`       |    2645 |  0.38 ms | 125.88 MB/s |
| `md4w (md4c)`       |    1866 |  0.54 ms |  88.80 MB/s |
| `markdown-it`       |     526 |  1.90 ms |  25.05 MB/s |
| `marked`            |     305 |  3.28 ms |  14.52 MB/s |
| `micromark`         |      29 | 35.02 ms |   1.36 MB/s |
| `remark`            |      24 | 41.24 ms |   1.15 MB/s |

In this latest local release-build sweep, Ox Content came out on top for both parse-only and parse+render in the large 48.7 KB case while still serving as the native core for the full documentation pipeline.

Reproduce with:

```bash
node benchmarks/bundle-size/parse-benchmark.mjs
```

The benchmark includes `md4w (md4c)` and `md4x (napi)` by default and adds `Bun.markdown.html` automatically when `bun` is available.
