Special thanks to [ryoppippi](https://github.com/ryoppippi) for production
migration feedback on Markdown attributes and rich social embed parity.

Contribution summary:

  found during the ryoppippi.com Ox Content migration.

  sveltweet.
- Requested self-hosted web font acquisition for the built-in theme during the
  ryoppippi.com migration.
- Requested self-hosted Iconify CSS for used icons during the ryoppippi.com
  migration.
- Reported the need for host-only redirect output without redundant HTML
  fallback pages during the ryoppippi.com migration.
- Reported that closing Vite middleware servers could repeat production SSG
  output writes during the ryoppippi.com migration.
- The opt-in `<NotByAI />` authorship badge was requested and first shipped
  in production during the ryoppippi.com Ox Content migration.
- Reported that generated feed item URLs missed `ssg.routePrefix` while page
  output and Markdown companions were mounted under the prefix.
- Requested programmatic feed item sources for the ryoppippi.com JSON-backed
  media feed migration.
- Reported prose typography stylesheet interactions with rich magic-link
  avatars during the ryoppippi.com migration.
- Reported the custom-host Markdown table migration that led to the
  browser-only table helper entrypoint and isolated table stylesheet.
- Requested class-based dark-mode support for Twitter/X full-card styles.
- Reported Twitter/X full-card action control and replies-placement geometry
  mismatches against sveltweet production cards.

  downstream migration without a site-specific listener.

  sveltweet reference contract.

  ryoppippi.com integration.
- Requested the collection asset URL rewriter, public external-feed ingestion,
  redirect-output planner/writer, Solid HTML-string host adapter, and Solid
  island stylesheet resolver used by custom hosts.
- Reported that Solid HTML-string hosts needed a browser-only lazy client
  contract with cancellable island lifecycle and document-scoped module
  identities.
- Requested the first-paint theme bootstrap, typed document asset renderer, and
  framework-owned custom-host Vite lifecycle that removes downstream plugin
  orchestration.
- Requested custom-host coordinated feed data, production HTML minification,
  and Twitter/X profile avatar shape parity during the ryoppippi.com migration.

### bulebrainbrand

reporting the Windows SSG panic in the Vite plugin.

Contribution summary:

visual contract — layout, color tokens, and control icons — follows
[react-tweet](https://github.com/vercel/react-tweet) (MIT, Copyright (c) 2023
Luis Alvarez) and [sveltweet](https://github.com/ryoppippi/sveltweet) (MIT,
Copyright (c) 2024 ryoppippi). Ox Content does not depend on those packages at
runtime.

### Not By AI badge artwork

The opt-in `<NotByAI />` badge vendors the official light and dark “Written
by Human, Not By AI” SVGs from [Not By AI](https://notbyai.fyi). The copies
are sanitized at vendoring time and inlined as static HTML. Ox Content does
not load scripts or assets from notbyai.fyi at runtime.
