//! Scans that only report absence after walking to the end of their input.
//!
//! Every fix behind this test is the same shape. A pass looks for something
//! — a closing `]`, a `}`, a `>`, a `<!--`, a `://` — and the search reports
//! "not here" only after reading everything left. Run once that is fine. Run
//! once per element of a run, which is what these passes do, and it is
//! O(n²): the input that triggers it is ordinary text, not a crafted
//! document.
//!
//! Measured before the fixes, on one line at 16 KiB against 64 KiB:
//!
//!     [        unclosed link          x16.8    (parser, #1227)
//!     {        unclosed attribute     x19.2    (attrs)
//!     <        unclosed tag           x14.1    (parser)
//!     *[`      code span + bracket    x11.9    (segments)
//!     @[a](b)  text between links     x19.0    (parser)
//!     a@b.com  one autolink per line  x15.1    (parser)
//!
//! The assertion is a ratio, not a time: 4x the input must not cost 8x the
//! work. Linear is about x4 and quadratic about x16, so the budget sits
//! between with room on both sides for a busy runner.
